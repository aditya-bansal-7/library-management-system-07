### ‚öôÔ∏è MySQL Database Setup
Before running the LMS application, you need to set up a MySQL database with the structure provided in the `SQL/lms.sql` file.

#### Step 1: Setting up MySQL Database
1. **Create Database:** Create a new MySQL database for LMS.
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE lms;
    USE lms;
    ```
2. **Run `SQL/lms.sql`:** Execute the lms.sql file to create the tables and relations in the database
    ```bash
    mysql -u yourUsername -p library_system < lms.sql
    ```
    
 #### Step 2: Configure `application.properties`
 Set up the `resources/application.properties` file to link the application with your MySQL database:
 ```properties
# Database connection properties

db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/lms
db.user=root
db.password="YOUR_PASSWORD"
```
